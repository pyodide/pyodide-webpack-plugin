# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pyodide Webpack Plugin! There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them. Here are some guidelines & pointers for diving into it.

## Development Workflow

To contribute code, see the following steps,

1. Fork the Pyodide repository https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-webpack-plugin on Github.
2. Clone your fork of Pyodide Webpack Plugin\
   `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pyodide-webpack-plugin.git`\
   and add the upstream remote,\
   `git remote add upstream https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-webpack-plugin.git`
3. Nodejs [22.x or 24.x](https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. Install requirements\
   `npm i`
5. See Testing and benchmarking documentation.

## Testing

Run the full suite of tests including a fresh build, lint, formatting, and unit tests with:

```
npm test
```

You can run individual steps of the test by looking in [package.json](./package.json) for different scripts. `npm run unit` is useful for rerunning unit tests quickly.

### Unit Tests

Unit testing currently tests against the [examples](./examples/). There are a few things to note:

- Tests happen against the built plugin. You must run `npm run build` before you test if any of your code has changes. `npm test` runs the build as part of the test phase.
- Your example must contain a `webpack.config.js` and must export webpack itself
- New examples need to be initialized with npm workspaces `npm init -w examples/<example name>`
- New examples are automatically picked up for the build targets and test phase

> running `npx webpack --watch` can be faster than running `npm run build` if you are iterating over the plugin and testing. Use in conjunction with `npm run unit` for fast test iteration.

## Code of Conduct

Pyodide has adopted a [Code of Conduct](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/code-of-conduct.html#code-of-conduct) that we expect all contributors and core members to adhere to.

## Development

Work on Pyodide happens on GitHub. Core members and contributors can make Pull Requests to fix issues and add features, which all go through the same review process. We'll detail how you can start making PRs below.

We'll do our best to keep `main` in a non-breaking state, ideally with tests always passing. The unfortunate reality of software development is sometimes things break. As such, `main` cannot be expected to remain reliable at all times. We recommend using the latest stable version of Pyodide.

Pyodide follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) - major versions for breaking changes (x.0.0), minor versions for new features (0.x.0), and patches for bug fixes (0.0.x).

We keep a file, [docs/changelog.md](./docs/changelog.md), outlining changes to Pyodide in each release. We like to think of the audience for changelogs as non-developers who primarily run the latest stable. So the change log will primarily outline user-visible changes such as new features and deprecations, and will exclude things that might otherwise be inconsequential to the end user experience, such as infrastructure or refactoring.

## Bugs & Issues

We use [Github Issues](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-webpack-plugin/issues) for announcing and discussing bugs and features. Use [this link](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-webpack-plugin/issues/new) to report a bug or issue. We provide a template to give you a guide for how to file optimally. If you have the chance, please search the existing issues before reporting a bug. It's possible that someone else has already reported your error. This doesn't always work, and sometimes it's hard to know what to search for, so consider this extra credit. We won't mind if you accidentally file a duplicate report.

Core contributors are monitoring new issues & comments all the time, and will label & organize issues to align with development priorities.

## How to Contribute

Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change Pyodide. GitHub itself has some [great documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) on using the Pull Request feature. We use the "fork and pull" model [described here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), where contributors push changes to their personal fork and create pull requests to bring those changes into the source repository.

Please make pull requests against the `main` branch.

If you're looking for a way to jump in and contribute, our list of [good first issues](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-webpack-plugin/labels/good%20first%20issue) is a great place to start.

If you'd like to fix a currently-filed issue, please take a look at the comment thread on the issue to ensure no one is already working on it. If no one has claimed the issue, make a comment stating you'd like to tackle it in a PR. If someone has claimed the issue but has not worked on it in a few weeks, make a comment asking if you can take over, and we'll figure it out from there.

We use [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha). Every PR will automatically run through our tests, and our test framework will alert you on GitHub if your PR doesn't pass all of them. If your PR fails a test, try to figure out whether or not you can update your code to make the test pass again, or ask for help. As a policy we will not accept a PR that fails any of our tests, and will likely ask you to add tests if your PR adds new functionality. Writing tests can be scary, but they make open-source contributions easier for everyone to assess. Take a moment and look through how we've written our tests, and try to make your tests match. If you are having trouble, we can help you get started on our test-writing journey.

All code submissions should pass `npm run test`. TypeScript is checked with prettier.

## Documentation

Documentation is a critical part of any open source project, and we are very welcome to any documentation improvements. Pyodide has a documentation written in Markdown in the `docs/` folder. We use the MyST for parsing Markdown in sphinx. You may want to have a look at the MyST syntax guide when contributing, in particular regarding cross-referencing sections.

## Migrating patches

It often happens that patches need to be migrated between different versions of upstream packages.

If patches fail to apply automatically, one solution can be to

1. Checkout the initial version of the upstream package in a separate repo, and create a branch from it.
2. Add existing patches with `git apply <path.path>`
3. Checkout the new version of the upstream package and create a branch from it.
4. Cherry-pick patches to the new version,\
   `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`\
   and resolve conflicts.
5. Re-export last `N` commits as patches e.g.\
   `git format-patch -<N> -N --no-stat HEAD -o <out_dir>`
